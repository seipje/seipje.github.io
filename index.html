		<h3>Beginnings</h3>
		<p> A few years ago, I was at Staples and randomly decided to pick up a game called Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst, published by Big Fish Games. I had never heard of the series or of Big Fish Games itself, but the art on the cover was cool and the synopsis on the back of the case looked promising. As soon as I started playing, the art blew me away and the story kept me on the edge of my seat. I remember playing it in the middle of the night when everything was dark and quiet, which added even more suspense to an already suspenseful game.
<br>
<br>
Return to Ravenhearst is the fifth installment in the Mystery Case Files series, and since I'd never played the previous games, I didn't know any of the backstory. But I didn't care; I was excited to find out where it would take me! The fact that I wanted to play it anyway and that they told enough of the previous story for me to understand what was going on says a lot about the game.
<br>
<br>
Little did I know that the game would open up a whole new world for me. Not only did I become very interested in art (although the game doesn't get sole credit for that), but it also caused me to go out and look for other games that had awesome art and stories.
<br>
<br>
Naturally, that road led me to my love of indie games. I love the Humble Indie Bundle (although I don't have much time to play as many of the games as I want to), but among my favorite are Trine (Frozenbyte) and Bastion (Supergiant). This journey also inspired me to learn skills that would enable me to make awesome games like the ones that I had discovered.
<br>
<br>
My alma mater, Northern Kentucky University, has a great program called Media Informatics, which in simplified terms could be called "interactive media." I decided to minor in MIN (my major was  Computer Information Technology). In that program, I learned design principles, media scripting, and 2D and 3D animation. But the best part was that through MIN, I met my business partner, Erin Flick.
<br>
<br>
I was so lucky to find in her not only a talented artist and designer, but someone who loves similar types of games as I do. And she is also interested in creating games that focus on story and art, which has been my goal since I started playing Big Fish's games all those years ago.
<br>
<br>
We were working as a team on a game project for one of our MIN classes, and we discovered that she and I make a great team. There were several times that we'd say to each other "I wish we could make games together after graduation..." That was just an idle dream until we had the idea to apply to NKU's summer business accelerator program, the INKUBATOR. We took the application process very seriously, and we spent quite a few weeks stressing about it and being nervous, but all that work paid off! We were accepted into the program this summer.
<br>
<br>
We have learned so much, including how to handle the hiring process (because we added three other talented people to our team), how to develop a business model, the importance of getting out to talk to our customers, and the benefits of networking.
<br>
<br>
But we're just at the beginning of our journey, and we're excited to share it with you!
<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading and happy gaming!
